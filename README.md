# GrowBeets

Studies have shown that playing different sound frequencies can stimulate growth for various plants! We took this idea and implemented a playlist-making web app that allows a user to enter the name of a plant, retrieve the optimal growth frequency, and create a 10 song playlist their plants can dance to.
